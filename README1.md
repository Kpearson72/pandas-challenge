### Challenge Taken:

* Created a new repository called "pandas-challenge", then cloned it to my computer. 
* Created a directory named PyCitySchools.
* Added my Jupyter Notebook to this folder: [link to jupyter notebook](http://localhost:8888/?token=ce4524f738fe34f752bd26deb5a68449c37f6cb28e34b154)
.
* Pushed changes/revisions to GitHub
* Played the role of Chief Data Scientist for the local school district. I helped the school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
---------------------------------------
## Chief Data Scientist - Actions:

1. Created a final report that includes:
    *  District Summary - high level snapshot (table form) of the district's key metrics

    *  School Summary - summarizes key metrics about each school

    *  Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) - create a table highlighting top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.

    *  Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) - create a table highlighting bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.

    *  Math Scores by Grade - create a table that lists the average Math scores for student by grade.

    *  Reading Scores by Grade - create a table that lists the average Reading scores for student by grade.

    *  Scores by School Spending - create a table that breaks down school performances based on average spending ranges.

    *  Scores by School Size - create a table that breaks down school performances based on school size.

    *  Scores by School Type - create a table that breaks down school performances based on school type.

2. Analyzed the district-wide standardized test results - two observable trends.

    * Trend 1  - Charter Schools with less student population tend to have a higher % Overall Passing scores for math and reading standarized tests than the higher populated District schools. This is observed by comparing the two tables for Top/Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

    * Trend 2 - The test scores are not influenced by how much money a school receives for each student but rather the population size of the school. This is observed by Scores by School Spending table and Scores by School Size table.

    Final Analysis - Population is a the key factor to a schools success of higher test scores. Crowded classrooms and schools give less indivdualized attention/help per student.
