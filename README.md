### Challenge Taken:

* Created a new repository called "pandas-challenge", then cloned it to my computer. 
* Created a directory named PyCitySchools.
* Added my Jupyter Notebook to this folder: [link to jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Kpearson72/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter-FINAL.ipynb)
.
* Pushed changes/revisions to GitHub
* Played the role of Chief Data Scientist for the local school district. I helped the school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
---------------------------------------
## Chief Data Scientist - Actions:

1. Created a final report that includes:
    *  District Summary - high level snapshot (table form) of the district's key metrics

    *  School Summary - summarizes key metrics about each school

    *  Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) - create a table highlighting top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.

    *  Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) - create a table highlighting bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.

    *  Math Scores by Grade - create a table that lists the average Math scores for student by grade.

    *  Reading Scores by Grade - create a table that lists the average Reading scores for student by grade.

    *  Scores by School Spending - create a table that breaks down school performances based on average spending ranges.

    *  Scores by School Size - create a table that breaks down school performances based on school size.

    *  Scores by School Type - create a table that breaks down school performances based on school type.

2. Analyzed the district-wide standardized test results - observed two trends:

    * Trend 1  - Charter Schools with a low student population tend to have a higher % Overall Passing scores for math and reading standarized tests than the higher populated District schools. This is observed by comparing the two tables for Top/Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing). Charter schools are top performers and District schools are bottom performers.

    * Trend 2 - The test scores are not influenced by how much money a school receives for each student but rather the population size of the school. This is observed by Scores by School Spending table and Scores by School Size table. Charter schools (top performers) have generally received less money than District schools.

    ## Final Analysis - Population, whether low or high, is the key factor to a school's success or failure to achieving higher test scores. Crowded classrooms and schools give less indivdualized attention/help per student, resulting in low test scores for students.
